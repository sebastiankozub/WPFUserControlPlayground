# WPFUserControlPlayground

## TriggerListAdd 

WPF UserControl that refresh its visual state when rows to internal collection are added. Updating second column with delegate given with row item to control or the one given in control bindings when not given with row separately. Few more improvments on the way.

### TODO

!!! Wrong binding pattern

   - row delete
   - row update when no value or error

### AnotherUserControl
